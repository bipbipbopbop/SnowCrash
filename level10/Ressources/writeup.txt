We found an executable level10, that asks us for a file and a host, we also found that it uses the port 6969 using strings ~/level10.
We used the current IP as the host, using nc, we listen to the socket to see that it prints the content of the file passed as a parameter.
When we try to put ~/token as the parameter, we have permission errors, it uses access to check these permissions.
After some research, we found that there is a race condition exploit possible with access, we will then exploit that to print the content of the file ~/token.

We first used the following command:
nc -l -k <IP> 6969 &
This will listen to the port 6969 that the program uses in the background.

Then, we made a shell script that alternates creating a file with making a symlink to ~/token, this is our exploit.sh script.
It will be used to take advantage of the race condition happening in the program.

Finally, we simply run the program indefinitely until we end up with our password for flag10, this is the run.sh file.
