We found nothing in the home, and the command:
`find / -user 3014 2> /dev/null`
gives us nothing. So we decided to bypass the reverse security on getflag.

We need 3 breakpoints in order to complete our mission:
- At the beginning, to identify the offset of the 2 others,
- At the ptrace() return value checking : we must ignore the error value returned.
- At the getuid() return value storing : we must change that value to 3014, the UID of flag14.
All these operations involve the register EAX. Then, with the gdb instruction `set $eax=VALUE`, we can modify the value of the register.

Once this is done, resuming the program execution will give us the requested key as output.
