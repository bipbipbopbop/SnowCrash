A .pl is present in the home. It is a Perl script. The comment `localhost:4747` is a hint to call the script through the curl tool.
It has "s" in the execution permissions, meaning it will set its uid to flag04 in this case:
level04@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar  5  2016 level04.pl

`curl localhost:4747` return an empty line, which means the call was successful. We then try to pass a parameter to the curl request.
From the perl function x call, we understood that only the parameter named "x" will be print.
`curl localhost:4747?x=yeet` print "yeet".

Then, by passing litteral backticks around the string to print, we can execute any command thanks to the Bash Command Substitution. Thus, with the following command:
curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\`

We can retrieve the token for the next level.
