Get the list of all users and their PID:
cat /etc/passwd

Get the PID for flag00, in this case 3000:
flag00:x:3000:3000::/home/flag/flag00:/bin/bash

Find all files associated to a PID (https://linuxhandbook.com/uid-linux/), and ignore stderr:
find / -user 3000 2> /dev/null

2 files remain, they both have the same content:
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

We noticed it didn't look like a string encrypted by an algorithm like MD5, SHA, so we tried all rotN algorithms until we found a coherent string
rot11 of cdiiddwpgswtgt gave us nottoohardhere, which is the password for flag00
